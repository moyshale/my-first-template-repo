## notes
You can create a template from an existing repository. Anyone with access to the template repository can create a new repository based on the template with the same directory structure, branches, and files..

To create a template repository, you must create a repository, then make the repository a template.

After you make your repository a template, anyone with access to the repository can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as your default branch. They can also choose to include all the other branches in your repository. Branches created from a template have unrelated histories

__Note__: Your template repository cannot include files stored using Git LFS.

__Note__: You can use a template repository as starter code for an assignment on GitHub Classroom.
